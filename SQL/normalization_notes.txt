- The original unnormalized design had multiple of the same categories on the same line or id. 
This would be hard to query because each book was fiction and adding or removing additional categories
could be a little messy. 

- To go from UNF to 1NF we removed "book_categories" to its own chart to ensure each row is unique. 
To go from 1NF to 2NF we must remove all partial dependencies and replace category name in book categories with category id.
To go from 2NF to 3NF you have to ensure that non-key attributes don't depend on other non-key attributes.

- Relational databases don't allow you to store multiple foreign keys in a single column. Join tables
hold those foreign keys.
